  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.</p>
  <p>HTML is a command that defines the size, color, shape, graphics, and movement of documents (hyperlinks) of a document and is used to create a homepage.<br>
    The command used in HTML is called a tag, and it is represented by a bracket "<>".<br>
    In general, tags are made up of two pairs indicating the beginning and the end, but sometimes only the start tag shows the effect, such as tags such as "img" and "br", and the name of the end tag starts with a slash character [/].<br>
    In this way, documents written in HTML are called HTML documents, and web browsers interpret the documents written in HTML and show them to users.<br>
    HTML not only allows documents to recognize separate codes to create complete hypertext, but also to link words or paragraphs to other places or files on the Internet.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">HTML was created to define the format of electronic documents and was defined as a subset of the international standard SGML.<br>
    HTML is a language created by emphasizing hypertext in SGML in particular, and consists of general text in ASCII code.<br>
    This language does not require a separate compiler and is in the spotlight as an easy-to-use language that can be interpreted in a web browser.
